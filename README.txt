The implementations are in java and so javac is used to complie it.
There are two driver classes one for simulated annealing and one for genetic.
The simulated file is named "testDriver"
The genetic is named "geneDriver"
Neither has a ui and will perform their individual tests.
In the case of simulated it will run 50 tests
In the case of genetic it will run 10 simply because it is slower
In order to change the number of tests there is a commented line
above the loop that needs to be changed to do so.
